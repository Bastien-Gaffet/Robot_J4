# ü§ñ Robot J4 ‚Äì Connect Four Playing Robotic Arm Using the Minimax Algorithm

## üìå Project Overview

**Robot J4** is a custom-designed robotic arm built to autonomously play **Connect Four** against a human player. The project combines **mechanical design**, **embedded systems**, and **algorithmic strategy** to showcase human-robot interaction in a fun and intelligent way.

At the heart of the decision-making process lies the **Minimax algorithm**, a classical strategy from **game theory** commonly used in two-player, turn-based games like chess or Connect Four. Robot J4 evaluates potential moves up to a certain depth and selects the most optimal action to either **win or block** the opponent.

## üéØ Objectives

- Build a robotic arm capable of dropping game pieces into a real-world Connect Four board.
- Create a smooth and interactive human-vs-machine gameplay loop.
- Use the **Minimax algorithm** with a heuristic evaluation function.
- Establish a **serial communication** link between a PC and the robot via UART.
- Design a modular, maintainable Python interface for interaction and logic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** (game engine, Minimax logic, and user interface)
- **Minimax algorithm** with custom heuristics
- **Arduino** (motor control and robot commands)
- **Serial communication (UART)** for computer-to-robot interaction
- **Mechanical design** (custom robotic arm for token handling)
- *(Optional ‚Äì future upgrade)* **Computer vision** for automated board state recognition

## üöÄ How It Works

1. The first player (robot J4 or human) is determined randomly at the start of the game.  
2. A camera films the Connect Four board in real time, enabling the robot to track the game‚Äôs progress and know the current state of the grid.  
3. When it‚Äôs J4‚Äôs turn, the robot analyzes the board using the Minimax algorithm and chooses the optimal move.  
4. J4 physically drops the token into the selected column.  
5. The human player plays next, and the robot detects their move automatically via the camera feed.  
6. The cycle continues with real-time board recognition until one player wins or the board is full.

## üì¶ Repository Structure
