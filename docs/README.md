# BCN3D-Moveo â€” Reference Files

This folder contains files identical to those found on the official GitHub repository of the BCN3D Moveo robotic arm:

ðŸ”— [BCN3D/BCN3D-Moveo GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3D-Moveo)

These files are provided here for reference purposes only.

## Why are these files included?

Although we worked using **Onshape** (a cloud-based CAD platform), we include the original files here:

- To document the starting point of our mechanical design work.
- To maintain a consistent reference in case the Onshape link becomes unavailable.
- To support reproducibility of the project for future contributors.

## Original Design Link on Onshape

You can view the model we used as a base directly on Onshape at the following link:
